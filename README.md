## Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze and predict factors that influence women's employment rates. By leveraging machine learning techniques and the technologies mentioned, the project will provide insights into the key determinants of women's employment and create a predictive model to estimate employment rates based on various factors.

## Steps to Follow:
 
1. 	Data Collection:
 
  	- Gather a dataset containing information on women's employment rates and related variables. We can explore sources such as government databases, international organizations, or research publications. (The dataset needs to have at least 100 records)
 
2. 	Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
 
  	- Use Python Pandas to load and preprocess the dataset. Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data cleaning steps.
  	- Analyze and visualize the dataset using Python Matplotlib or other visualization libraries. Identify potential relationships between different variables and their impact on women's employment.
 
3. 	Feature Selection and Engineering:
 
  	- Select relevant features from the dataset that may affect women's employment rates. We can use correlation analysis or domain knowledge to determine the most significant variables.
 
4. 	Model Building and Evaluation:
 
  	- Utilize Scikit-learn or other ML libraries to build a predictive model. Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., regression, classification) based on the nature of the problem.
  	- Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error).
  	- Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different algorithms to improve the results.
 
5. 	Deployment and Visualization:
 
  	- Once the model is trained and performs well, create a user-friendly interface to showcase the results. We can use HTML/CSS/Bootstrap to design a web page or dashboard.
  	- Implement interactive visualizations using JavaScript Plotly or JavaScript Leaflet to present the insights gained from the analysis.
  	- If applicable, integrate the model with a SQL or MongoDB database to enable real-time predictions or store user inputs for future analysis.
 
6. 	Documentation and Presentation:
 
  	- Create a report summarizing the project, including the problem statement, data sources, methodology, results, and conclusions.
  	- Prepare a presentation to showcase the project's findings, methodologies, and the impact of the factors identified on women's employment rates.
